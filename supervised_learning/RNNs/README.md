# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This directory contains implementations of various Recurrent Neural Network architectures and components. Each task builds upon the previous one to create a comprehensive understanding of RNNs and their variants.

## Tasks Overview

| Task | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | [RNN Cell](0-rnn_cell.py) | Implementation of a basic RNN cell class that handles the fundamental recurrent computation |
| 1 | [RNN](1-rnn.py) | Forward propagation implementation for a simple RNN network |
| 2 | [GRU Cell](2-gru_cell.py) | Implementation of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cell, which helps address the vanishing gradient problem |
| 3 | [LSTM Cell](3-lstm_cell.py) | Implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, a more sophisticated RNN architecture |
| 4 | [Deep RNN](4-deep_rnn.py) | Implementation of forward propagation for a deep RNN with multiple layers |
| 5 | [Bidirectional Cell Forward](5-bi_forward.py) | Implementation of forward pass for a bidirectional RNN cell |
