# hmm
This directory contains work with Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models:

## Mandatory Tasks:

| Task # | Task Name | Description | File |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Markov Chain | Write a function that determines the probability of a markov chain being in a particular state after a specified number of iterations. | [0-markov_chain.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/0-markov_chain.py) |
| 1 | Regular Chains | Write a function that determines the steady state probabilities of a regular markov chain. | [1-regular.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/1-regular.py) |
| 2 | Absorbing Chains | Write a function that determines if a markov chain is absorbing. | [2-absorbing.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/2-absorbing.py) |
| 3 | The Forward Algorithm | Write a function that performs the forward algorithm for a hidden markov model. | [3-forward.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/3-forward.py) |
| 4 | The Viterbi Algorithm | Write a function that calculates the most likely sequence of hidden states for a hidden markov model. | [4-viterbi.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/4-viterbi.py) |
| 5 | The Backward Algorithm | Write a function that performs the backward algorithm for a hidden markov model. | [5-backward.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/5-backward.py) |
| 6 | The Baum-Welch Algorithm | Write a function that performs the Baum-Welch algorithm for a hidden markov model. | [6-baum_welch.py](/unsupervised_learning/hmm/6-baum_welch.py) |
